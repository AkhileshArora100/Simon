<h2 class="mario">How To Play</h2>

<p>Press any key/ click anywhere to start the Game. The Skill Level increases by one each time.</p>
<p>Simon will give the first signal by pressing a button. Repeat the signal by pressing the same color button or the key that is written on it.</p>
<p>Simon will duplicate the first signal and add one. Repeat these two signals by pressing the same color button in the same order.</p>
<p>Simon will duplicate these first two signals and add one. Similarly the game will keep adding a signal each time you clear a level.</p>
<p>Continue playing as long as you can repeat each sequence of signals correctly. After the 5th, 9th and 13th signals in a sequence, Simon automatically speeds up.</p>
<p>If you fail to repeat a sequence exactly, Simon responds with a "RAZZ" sound. This means you've lost, and the sequence of signals ends.</p><!-- or if you take more than 5 seconds to repeat a signal, -->
